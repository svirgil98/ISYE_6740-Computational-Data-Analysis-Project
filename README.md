# ISYE_6740-Computational-Data-Analysis-Project
Video Game Recommendation System

Using user data from Steam, I created a video game recommendation engine in Python> I used Sci-kit Learn's Nearest Neighbors algorithm to generate game recommendations using content based filtering.

The file "Analysis.ipnyb" contains the implementation of the recommendation engine and the file "ISYE6740_Project_Final_Report.pdf" contains details on my approach, methods, and findings.
